# 01 Introduction to Sampling techniques

============================ Definations ==============================

Population: the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.

Population Size: Population size is the number of unit, which constitutes the population.

Fubute Population: If a population has definite number of units, then it is called finite population.

Infinite population: If a population has uncountable number of unites, then it is called infinite population.

Target Population: Target population is the complete collection of observation we want to study.

Sample Population: The collection of all possible observation units that might have been chosen in a sample, is called sample population.

Sample: Sample is a representative part of the population.

Sample Size: Sample size is the number of units contained in a sample.

Sample Unite: A sampling unit or simply unit is a well defined, distinct and identifiable element or group of elements on which observation can be made.

Random Sample: Any sample selected by chance mechanism with known chance of selection is called a random somple.

Sampling Technique: Sampling techniqueis a scientific process of selecting a sample from a population.

Unit fo Inquiry: A unit of inquiry is the unit about which information is required.

Sampling Frame: A sampling frame is a complete list of all units of the population.

Parameter: Population characteristic is called parameter.

Statistic: Sample characteristic is called statistic.

Extimator: An estimator is a statistic that estimates some fact about the population 

Estimate: A particular value of the estimator is called an estimate.

Survey: Survey is a general term that refers to the collection of data by interviews, questionnaires or direct observations.

Sample Survey: The technique of collecting information from a portion of the population is called a sample survey.

Census: A survey that includes every member of the population is called a census.

> Non Probabilit Smapling:
Non probability sampling is a method of selecting units from a population using a subjective method.

Some non probability sampling are:-
- Convenience Sampling: Non probability samples that are unrestricted are known as convenience samples. Researchers or field workers have the freedom to choose whomever they find.
- Accidental Sampling: An accidental type of sampling is one in which the selection of the cases is made whatever happens to be available instantly.
- Purposive Sampling: A non probability sampling method that conforms to certain criteria is called purposive sampling. 
- Judgment Sampling: Judgment sampling is one in which the cases are included for investigation through a planned selection procedure.
- Quota Sampling: Quota sampling is a non probability sampling in which the interviewers are told to contact and interview a certain number of individuals from certain sub groups of the population to make up the total sample.
- Snowball Sampling: Snowball sampling is non probability sampling in which persons initially chosen for the sample are used as informants to locate other persons having necessary characteristics making them eligible for the sample through referral network.

Advantage of Non Probability Sampling: 
1. It may meet the sampling objectives satisfactorily in some instances. It may be perfectly adequate if the researcher has no desire to generalize his or her findings beyond the sample or if the study is a trial run for a longer study to be attempted at a later date.
2. In situations, where a truly representative probability sample is too complicated, time consuming, expensive and calls for more planning and repeated callbacks, a carefully controlled non probability sampling remains the only viable means of collecting data.
3. Some times it is impossible or too expensive to find enough cases of a particular type by using probability sampling. In such cases, non probability sampling may be the only feasible alternative.
4. Since it is less complicated and much less expensive, it may be executed on a spur-of the moment basis to take advantages of available respondents without the statistical complexity of a probability sampling.


Disadvantage of Non Probability Sampling:
1. If offers no insight into the reliability of the resulting estimates and hence, no generalization can be made regarding the population which is being sampled.
2. The investigator cannot claim that his or her sample is representative of the population, since the probability that a unit will be chosen is not known.
3. The investigator is unable to estimate the degree of departure from representation(Sampling error).
4. No sampling theory can be developed out of a non probability sample, since no element of random selection is involved.
5. No comparison of the result can be made for the non probability samples unless one can find a situation in which the results are known. either for the whole population or for a probability sample.

> Probability Sampling: 
Probability sampling means that every member of the target population has a known chance of being included in the sample.

02 Simple Random Sampling

Simple Random Sampling: Simple random sampling is the technique of drawing a sample in such away that each unit of the population has an equal and independent chance of being included in the sample.

Simple Random Sampling with Replacement:
Simple Random Sampling without Replacement:

Advantage of Simple Random Sampling:
1. It is simple to conceptualize.
2. It provides foundation for much of statistical theory.
3. It provides a basis to which other methods can be compared.
4. Since, the sampling units are selected at random giving each unit an equal chance of being selected, the element of subjectivity or personal bias is completely eliminated.


Disadvantage of Simple Random Sampling:
1. It requires an up-to-date frame from which samples are to be drawn. So, all units in the population must be identified and labeled prior to sampling. This process is potentially so expensive and time consuming that it becomes unrealistic to implement.
2. Sampled individuals may be so widely dispersed that visiting each selected individual may be extremely expensive and time consuming.
3. Certain subgroups in the population may be totally overlooked or may be over represented in the sample as a result o chance factor. In either case, the estimated parameters are likely to be in error.
4. When the population measurements very considerably in size, then simple random sample produces larger variances than other methods of sampling.
