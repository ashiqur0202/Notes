# 01 Introduction to Sampling techniques

============================ Definations ==============================

Population: the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.

Population Size: Population size is the number of unit, which constitutes the population.

Fubute Population: If a population has definite number of units, then it is called finite population.

Infinite population: If a population has uncountable number of unites, then it is called infinite population.

Target Population: Target population is the complete collection of observation we want to study.

Sample Population: The collection of all possible observation units that might have been chosen in a sample, is called sample population.

Sample: Sample is a representative part of the population.

Sample Size: Sample size is the number of units contained in a sample.

Sample Unite: A sampling unit or simply unit is a well defined, distinct and identifiable element or group of elements on which observation can be made.

Random Sample: Any sample selected by chance mechanism with known chance of selection is called a random somple.

Sampling Technique: Sampling techniqueis a scientific process of selecting a sample from a population.

Unit fo Inquiry: A unit of inquiry is the unit about which information is required.

Sampling Frame: A sampling frame is a complete list of all units of the population.

Parameter: Population characteristic is called parameter.

Statistic: Sample characteristic is called statistic.

Extimator: An estimator is a statistic that estimates some fact about the population 

Estimate: A particular value of the estimator is called an estimate.

Survey: Survey is a general term that refers to the collection of data by interviews, questionnaires or direct observations.

Sample Survey: The technique of collecting information from a portion of the population is called a sample survey.

Census: A survey that includes every member of the population is called a census.

=============================================================================================================================================================

> Non Probabilit Smapling:
Non probability sampling is a method of selecting units from a population using a subjective method.

Some non probability sampling are:-
- Convenience Sampling: Non probability samples that are unrestricted are known as convenience samples. Researchers or field workers have the freedom to choose whomever they find.
- Accidental Sampling: An accidental type of sampling is one in which the selection of the cases is made whatever happens to be available instantly.
- Purposive Sampling: A non probability sampling method that conforms to certain criteria is called purposive sampling. 
- Judgment Sampling: Judgment sampling is one in which the cases are included for investigation through a planned selection procedure.
- Quota Sampling: Quota sampling is a non probability sampling in which the interviewers are told to contact and interview a certain number of individuals from certain sub groups of the population to make up the total sample.
- Snowball Sampling: Snowball sampling is non probability sampling in which persons initially chosen for the sample are used as informants to locate other persons having necessary characteristics making them eligible for the sample through referral network.

Advantage of Non Probability Sampling: 
1. It may meet the sampling objectives satisfactorily in some instances. It may be perfectly adequate if the researcher has no desire to generalize his or her findings beyond the sample or if the study is a trial run for a longer study to be attempted at a later date.
2. In situations, where a truly representative probability sample is too complicated, time consuming, expensive and calls for more planning and repeated callbacks, a carefully controlled non probability sampling remains the only viable means of collecting data.
3. Some times it is impossible or too expensive to find enough cases of a particular type by using probability sampling. In such cases, non probability sampling may be the only feasible alternative.
4. Since it is less complicated and much less expensive, it may be executed on a spur-of the moment basis to take advantages of available respondents without the statistical complexity of a probability sampling.


Disadvantage of Non Probability Sampling:
1. If offers no insight into the reliability of the resulting estimates and hence, no generalization can be made regarding the population which is being sampled.
2. The investigator cannot claim that his or her sample is representative of the population, since the probability that a unit will be chosen is not known.
3. The investigator is unable to estimate the degree of departure from representation(Sampling error).
4. No sampling theory can be developed out of a non probability sample, since no element of random selection is involved.
5. No comparison of the result can be made for the non probability samples unless one can find a situation in which the results are known. either for the whole population or for a probability sample.

02 Simple Random Sampling

Simple Random Sampling: Simple random sampling is the technique of drawing a sample in such away that each unit of the population has an equal and independent chance of being included in the sample.

Simple Random Sampling with Replacement:
Simple Random Sampling without Replacement:

Drawing a simple random sample from a population requires that in every draw, each eligible
population element be assigned equal probability of selection. To ensure randomness in the
selection, the method of selection must be independent of human judgment as far as possible.
There are two basic procedures. They are
1) The lottery method: Lottery method is which each member of the population is identified by some means, such as by a marble, a disk, a piece of paper and so on. Lottery method is the simplest method of selecting a simple random sample. The lottery method is free from human bias and thus ensure randomness.
2) The use of random number table: A random number table is a table of digits. The digit given in each position in the table was originally chosen randomly from the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 by a random process in which each digit is equally likely to be chosen.
 The modified procedures of the use of random number table are-
 - Remainder method:
 - Quotient method:



Advantage of Simple Random Sampling:
1. It is simple to conceptualize.
2. It provides foundation for much of statistical theory.
3. It provides a basis to which other methods can be compared.
4. Since, the sampling units are selected at random giving each unit an equal chance of being selected, the element of subjectivity or personal bias is completely eliminated.


Disadvantage of Simple Random Sampling:
1. It requires an up-to-date frame from which samples are to be drawn. So, all units in the population must be identified and labeled prior to sampling. This process is potentially so expensive and time consuming that it becomes unrealistic to implement.
2. Sampled individuals may be so widely dispersed that visiting each selected individual may be extremely expensive and time consuming.
3. Certain subgroups in the population may be totally overlooked or may be over represented in the sample as a result o chance factor. In either case, the estimated parameters are likely to be in error.
4. When the population measurements very considerably in size, then simple random sample produces larger variances than other methods of sampling.


##################################################################################################################################################
04 Stratified Sampling

Stratified random sampling: Stratified random sampling is a method of sampling that involves the division of a populatin into smaller sub-groups known as strata.


Advantage of stratified sampling:
1) Stratification tends to decrease the variances of the sample estimates. This results in smaller bound on the error of estimation. This is particularly true if measurements within strata are homogeneous.
2) The cost per observation in the survey may be reduced by stratification.
3) When separate estimates for population parameters for each sub-population within an overall population are required, stratification is rewarding.
4) Stratification makes it possible to use different sampling designs in different strata.
5) Stratification is particularly more effective when there are extreme values in the population, which can be segregated into separate strata, thereby reducing the variability within strata.
6) Stratified sampling is most effective in handling heterogeneous population such as data on wages of industrial workers (which varies from industry to industry), amount of rain fall (which differs among various geographical areas) and the like.
7) Stratification provides a chance to improve sampling design considerably if the strata could be formed on the basis of natural characteristics.
8) In stratified sampling, confidence intervals may be constructed individually for the parameter of interest in each stratum. This is an added advantage over other methods of sampling.
9) The estimates in various strata may be made with whatever precision is desired simply by adjusting the sample size selected from each stratum. 

Disadvantage of stratified sampling:
The major disadvantage of stratified sampling is that it may take more time to select the
sample than would be the case for simple random sampling. More time is involved because
complete frames are necessary within each of the strata and each stratum must be sampled.

Allocating:
There are five methods of allocation of sample size to different strata in a stratified sampling procedure.
1. Arbitrary allocation: In arbitrary allocation, the choice of the sample size to different strata depends entirely on hte convenience of the sampler. (ni=n)
2. Equal allocation: In equal allocation the same number of elements is drawn from each stratum. (ni=n/k)
3. Proportional allocation: Proportional allocation sets the sample size in each stratum equal to be proportional to the number of sampling units in that stratum. (ni=(n/N)Ni)
4. Neyman allocation: Neyman allocation is a method used to allocate sample to strata based on the strata variances and similar sampling costs in the strata. A Neyman allocation scheme provides the most precision for estimating a population mean given a fixed total sample size. (ni=ANiSi)
5. Cost optimum allocation: In cost optimum allocation the sampling cost per unit of each stratum is different and the total sampling cost is fixed. This is also known as optimum allocation with fixed sampling cost. (ni=A(NiSi/√Ci)

07 Systematic Sampling


Systematic sampling: Systematic sampling is a probability sampling method where researchers select members of the population at a regular interval.

Linear systematic sampling: Suppose that a random sample of size n=3 desired from a population of size N=15. Here, k=N/n=15/3=5. To achive the desired sample size, select at random one of the first k=5 units and then every 5th unit in the sequence. eg- 1,6,11 or 5,10,15

Non-linear systematic sampling: Suppose that a random sample of size n=3 is desired from a population of size N=14. Here, k=N/n=14/3=4.67=5. To achieve the desired sample size, select at random one of the first k=5 five units and then every 5th unit in the sequence. eg-1,6,11 or 5,10

Circular systematic sampling: Suppose that a random sample of size n=3 is desired from a population of size N=14. Here, k=N/n=14/3=4.67=5. To achieve the desired sample size, select a unit by a random number between 01 and n inclusive. eg- 1,6,11 or 5,10,1

08 Single-stage Cluster Sampling

Cluster sampling: Cluster sampling is a probability sampling technique where researchers divide the population into multiple groups (clusters) for research.
