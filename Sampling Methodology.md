### Introduction to Sampling techniques ###

Population: the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.

Population Size: Population size is the number of unit, which constitutes the population.

Fubute Population: If a population has definite number of units, then it is called finite population.

Infinite population: If a population has uncountable number of unites, then it is called infinite population.

Target Population: Target population is the complete collection of observation we want to study.

Sample Population: The collection of all possible observation units that might have been chosen in a sample, is called sample population.

Sample: Sample is a representative part of the population.

Sample Size: Sample size is the number of units contained in a sample.

Sample Unite: A sampling unit or simply unit is a well defined, distinct and identifiable element or group of elements on which observation can be made.

Random Sample: Any sample selected by chance mechanism with known chance of selection is called a random somple.

Sampling Technique: Sampling techniqueis a scientific process of selecting a sample from a population.

Unit fo Inquiry: A unit of inquiry is the unit about which information is required.

Sampling Frame: A sampling frame is a complete list of all units of the population.

Parameter: Population characteristic is called parameter.

Statistic: Sample characteristic is called statistic.

Extimator: An estimator is a statistic that estimates some fact about the population 

Estimate: A particular value of the estimator is called an estimate.
