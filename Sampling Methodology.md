# Introduction to Sampling techniques

============================ Definations ==============================

Population: the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.

Population Size: Population size is the number of unit, which constitutes the population.

Fubute Population: If a population has definite number of units, then it is called finite population.

Infinite population: If a population has uncountable number of unites, then it is called infinite population.

Target Population: Target population is the complete collection of observation we want to study.

Sample Population: The collection of all possible observation units that might have been chosen in a sample, is called sample population.

Sample: Sample is a representative part of the population.

Sample Size: Sample size is the number of units contained in a sample.

Sample Unite: A sampling unit or simply unit is a well defined, distinct and identifiable element or group of elements on which observation can be made.

Random Sample: Any sample selected by chance mechanism with known chance of selection is called a random somple.

Sampling Technique: Sampling techniqueis a scientific process of selecting a sample from a population.

Unit fo Inquiry: A unit of inquiry is the unit about which information is required.

Sampling Frame: A sampling frame is a complete list of all units of the population.

Parameter: Population characteristic is called parameter.

Statistic: Sample characteristic is called statistic.

Extimator: An estimator is a statistic that estimates some fact about the population 

Estimate: A particular value of the estimator is called an estimate.

Survey: Survey is a general term that refers to the collection of data by interviews, questionnaires or direct observations.

Sample Survey: The technique of collecting information from a portion of the population is called a sample survey.

Census: A survey that includes every member of the population is called a census.

> Non Probabilit Smapling:
Non probability sampling is a method of selecting units from a population using a subjective method.

Some non probability sampling are:-
- Convenience Sampling: Non probability samples that are unrestricted are known as convenience samples. Researchers or field workers have the freedom to choose whomever they find.
- Accidental Sampling: An accidental type of sampling is one in which the selection of the cases is made whatever happens to be available instantly.
- Purposive Sampling: A non probability sampling method that conforms to certain criteria is called purposive sampling. 
- Judgment Sampling: Judgment sampling is one in which the cases are included for investigation through a planned selection procedure.
- Quota Sampling: Quota sampling is a non probability sampling in which the interviewers are told to contact and interview a certain number of individuals from certain sub groups of the population to make up the total sample.
- Snowball Sampling: Snowball sampling is non probability sampling in which persons initially chosen for the sample are used as informants to locate other persons having necessary characteristics making them eligible for the sample through referral network.

> Probability Sampling: 
Probability sampling means that every member of the target population has a known chance of being included in the sample.

Some probability sampling are:-
-Simple Random Sampling:
-Stratified Sampling:
-Systematic Sampling:
-Cluster Sampling
