# Introduction to Sampling techniques

============================ Definations ==============================

Population: the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.

Population Size: Population size is the number of unit, which constitutes the population.

Fubute Population: If a population has definite number of units, then it is called finite population.

Infinite population: If a population has uncountable number of unites, then it is called infinite population.

Target Population: Target population is the complete collection of observation we want to study.

Sample Population: The collection of all possible observation units that might have been chosen in a sample, is called sample population.

Sample: Sample is a representative part of the population.

Sample Size: Sample size is the number of units contained in a sample.

Sample Unite: A sampling unit or simply unit is a well defined, distinct and identifiable element or group of elements on which observation can be made.

Random Sample: Any sample selected by chance mechanism with known chance of selection is called a random somple.

Sampling Technique: Sampling techniqueis a scientific process of selecting a sample from a population.

Unit fo Inquiry: A unit of inquiry is the unit about which information is required.

Sampling Frame: A sampling frame is a complete list of all units of the population.

Parameter: Population characteristic is called parameter.

Statistic: Sample characteristic is called statistic.

Extimator: An estimator is a statistic that estimates some fact about the population 

Estimate: A particular value of the estimator is called an estimate.

Survey: Survey is a general term that refers to the collection of data by interviews, questionnaires or direct observations.

Sample Survey: The technique of collecting information from a portion of the population is called a sample survey.

Census: A survey that includes every member of the population is called a census.

> Non Probabilit Smapling:
Non probability sampling is a method of selecting units from a population using a subjective method.

Some non probability sampling are:-
- Convenience Sampling:
- Accidental Sampling:
- Purposive Sampling:
- Judgment Sampling:
- Quota Sampling:
- Snowball Sampling:

Advantage of Non Probability Sampling:

> Probability Sampling: 
Probability sampling means that every member of the target population has a known chance of being included in the sample.

Some probability sampling are:-
-Simple Random Sampling:
-Stratified Sampling:
-Systematic Sampling:
-Cluster Sampling
