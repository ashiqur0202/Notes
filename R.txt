2. Data types:
  1. Vector
  2. Matrix
  3. Array
  4. List
  5. Data frame
  
  1. Vector: A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type.
    Types of vector is - Logical, Integer, Numeric, Complex, Character 
  2. Matrix: Matrix are the R objects in which the elements are arranged in a two dimensional rectangular layout.
    Syntex-> matrix(data, nrow, ncol, byrow, dimnanes)
  3. Array: Array are the R data objects which can store data in more than two dimension
    Syntex-> array(data, dim, dimnanes)
  4. List: List are the R objects where contain elements of different types like numbers, strings, vectors and another list inside it.
    Syntes-> list(data)
  5. Data frame: Data frame is a table or a two dimension array like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains        one set of values from each column.
    Syntex-> data.frame(data)
    
3. Operations: Operations are the constants which can manipulate the value of operands.
  - Arithmetic
  - Relational
  - Logical
  - Assignment
  
4. Conditional statements:
  - If
    Syntex-> if (expression1){ //statements1}
                else if (expression2){  //statements2}
  - Switch care statement: 
    Syntex-> switch(expression 
                    case1 =#statement1
                    case2 =#statement2
                    ..................
                    default statement
                    )
